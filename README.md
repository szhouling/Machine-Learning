# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases proficiency in exploring and analyzing large high-dimensional datasets, building powerful predictive systems, and interpreting the structure in such models. The projects cover a range of topics including regression, treatment effect analysis, bootstrap methods, model selection, classification, clustering, factor analysis, decision trees, and neural networks.

The projects span diverse applications such as consumer data mining, internet and social media tracking, sports analytics, and text mining. By applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, these projects aim to provide practical insights and solutions to complex problems.
